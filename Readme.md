# FortifyScan Toolbox

## Overview

FortifyScan is a penetration testing framework developed by cyberknight. It is designed to assist security professionals in identifying and addressing vulnerabilities in web applications. The framework includes various features such as SQL vulnerability scanning, XSS vulnerability scanning, Denial-of-Service (DoS) testing, and brute-force attacks for FTP, SSH, and email accounts.

## Features

- **SQL Vulnerability Scanning:** Identify and assess SQL injection vulnerabilities in web applications.
- **XSS Vulnerability Scanning:** Detect and analyze Cross-Site Scripting vulnerabilities to enhance web security.
- **DoS Testing:** Perform Denial-of-Service tests to evaluate a system's resilience against disruptive attacks.
- **Brute-force FTP:** Test the security of FTP servers by attempting to crack passwords through brute-force attacks.
- **Brute-force SSH:** Assess the strength of SSH server security by attempting to guess login credentials.
- **Brute-force Email Accounts:** Evaluate the security of email accounts through brute-force attacks on login credentials.
